# Super-Sym
Contains mathematica code for L and R matrices and option to test the closure of the GRDN algebra. 

File "Garden Algebra" contains the code that runs the verification of the garden algebra. It also has the definitions of the L and R matrices. 
The other algebra RL + RL = delta + (non-closure) is also given. Explicit representation of any left (right) matrix is given by L[1] (R[1]) // Matrix Form (replace 1 with whichever index).
